```

- **[Objects](objects/README.md):** copy a complete model folder to use an object
  independently. Its URDF keeps relative references to its own meshes and notices.
- **[Environments](environments/README.md):** load an assembled scene with its
  placements, configuration and supporting assets. The medical laboratory is a
  complete environment, even though it contains individually movable objects.
- **[Web catalogue](https://sunava.github.io/private_meshes/):** browse all 162
  models, filter articulated or rigid objects, compare available poses and
  download complete model folders. The Laboratory category includes all five devices.

Model geometry, joint names, materials and scene placements are preserved by the
folder reorganisation. The laboratory environment remains a self-contained
runtime bundle; the portable device exports can be used without it.

## Load an individual model

```python
from semantic_digital_twin.adapters.urdf import URDFParser

world = URDFParser.from_file(
    "/path/to/private_meshes/objects/laboratory/centrifuge/model.urdf",
    prefix="centrifuge_one_",
).parse()
```

Use a distinct prefix for each instance. Coordinates are metres with Z up.
URDF loading supplies geometry and articulation; instrument controllers and
fluid simulation belong to the consuming laboratory application.

## Existing consumers and maintenance

The former top-level asset directories have moved. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md)
for the path mapping and an optional helper that restores the old entry points
locally for existing CRAMERA installations. No legacy aliases are tracked in Git.

In a CRAMERA checkout, these assets may live under `cramera/src/cramera/resources`.
The CRAM/CRAMERA application and the PR2 robot description are separate projects;
changes here do not update their source or packaging configuration automatically.

Run `python3 scripts/validate_resources.py` to check model and scene references.
The GitHub Actions workflow validates both asset groups before publishing the
catalogue. [site/README.md](site/README.md) describes local previews, the catalogue
build and how to add entries.
